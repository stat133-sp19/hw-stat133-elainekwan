Workout 01

STAT133 Spring 2019

GSI: Colin Khou

This workout is designed to provide an opportunity to create a more complex file struture, use analytics to visualize shot data of five Golden State Warriors players, and generate a report with a narrative to describe the analysis. Within the workout01 folder, there are five folders: code, data, images, output, and report. The code folder contains the scripts to prepare the data and create shot visualizations. The data folder contains the prepped data of all the players. The images folder contains all the image files used in report. The output folder contains plain text files with the summaries of the prepped player data. The report folder contains the narrative/workout report. 

After preparing the raw data of these players, we use R to generate a visual report of their shot data during the 2016-2017 basketball season. We also use R to generate shot percentages for each player. Finally, we produce a report in order to better explain the narrative and rationale behind our analysis.
